# System decomposition: The hard truths

When you are presented with a system, regardless of context (automation, greenfield development, or anything), how do you break it down to smaller pieces to work on, deploy and manage going forward?

There are a ton of books about software architecture out there with a lot of information in them. Some of them are even useful! If you read any of them, however, you will notice that while there's a lot of information in them about decomposing systems (and smaller components), there are very very few practical guidelines.

In this talk I will:
- Explain the theoretical "best" solution to software architecture
- Explain the relationship between system decomposition and 
- Rant about why the above is not a solution to our problems
- Try to explain the heuristics that are available to us and how I use them
- Maybe give you _some_ practical guidelines on software decomposition

After the above, I'll open the floor for a discussion about Domain-Driven Design, event sourcing, and general architecture and software development process Q&A
