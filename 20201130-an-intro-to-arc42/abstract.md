# An introduction to arc42

While arc42 is a template for documenting the architecture of a system, it's an interesting one. What makes it interesting is that this template was structured in such a way that it guides the architect to:

1. Focus on what is required
1. Author the architectural documentation in a way that facilitates communication
1. Help assure all interesting aspects are covered

During this talk, I will be presenting arc42, what it is, and how to author architectural documentation based on it. We'll start with a brief introduction of arc42 and why it may be of interest to you, before going into a more detailed explanation of each of the 12 sections that arc42 contains. In each section, I'll present guidelines regarding it, and how to best use it. Finally, I'll explain the relationship between arc42 and the C4 model, and how the two can work together.

After the overview, I'll be going over my experience with arc42, compare it with a couple of different approaches, and give my opinion of arc42, and its use in different kinds of environments.

By the end of the talk you should:

- Have an understanding of what arc42 is and what it is good for
- Know what information belongs in each section
- Have a basic understanding of how to fill in arc42
- Be aware of a couple of pitfalls
