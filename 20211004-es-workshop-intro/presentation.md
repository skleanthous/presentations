<!-- _class: lead -->
## There are three common problems in organizations

1. Evolution
2. (Invisible) Misalignment
3. Lack of holistic view

<!-- 
Evolution -> The software struggles to keep pace with the changing needs of the business. Moreover, there
Misalignment -> between software and business processes.
Lack of holistic view -> No-one has a holistic view of the business. Decisions are locally optimized. At worst locally optimized decisions can actively harm the organization

# Big picture event storming is:

> A chaotic and highly collaborative exploration of the whole, focusing on the behaviour

Also:

> An inclusive and more objective way to have meaningful discussions and make decisions

# Event Storming works

- A shared, holistic view
- Surfaces problems and inconsistencies, _and helps solve them_
- Discover natural "seam lines"
- And more...

<!--
- Heuristics to align software with business process
- Discussions finally happen

Event storming brings people with the right questions together with the people that have the answers, and gives them a tool to discuss. Importantly they all 
Event storming makes discussions more objective
Event storming is more inclusive because the visible model allows others to contribute

By discovering conflicts and inconsistencies, and discussing and solving them, we can discover seam lines.

# Expectations from you

- Actively contribute - get out of your comfort zone
- No messaging, no calls, no emails (unless it's an emergency)
- Focus
- Relax during the frequent short breaks

---

<!-- _header: "Workshop guidelines 4/8" -->
# Things you should know

- Add stickies, even if you're not sure
- This is a safe environment
- There are no wrong answers

---

<!-- _header: "Workshop guidelines 5/8" -->
# There are no wrong answers

- The cost of missing information can be large
- Mistakes are easy to fix
- EventStorming is a very cost-efficient way to experiment

---

<!-- _header: "Workshop guidelines 6/8" -->
# At the end

- We do **not** expect a clean model
- We **do** expect:
   - A clean, end-to-end narrative
   - Clear picture of problems
   - A _useful_ model

# Domain events

---

# Domain events

- Orange stickies
- Past tense
- They can be many things, but always important to the domain (and domain expert)

<!--

Domain events may be:
  - State changes
  - Important occurances
  - Any important things that happen in your system
  - not technical
  - Don't think messages going over a message bus

  - BUT: if you're not sure, better record it,
